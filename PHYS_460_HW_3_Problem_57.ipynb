    "We are now ready to consider how photons $\\textbf{interact}$ with matter on scales larger than the size of an atom. We begin with a simple case: photons pass through a gas in which some of the photons are absorbed by atoms. In Figure 5.9 (below), we consider light entering a medium with some intensity $I$, where the intensity specifies the number of photons passing through a unit area in a particular direction per unit time. We consider the interactions occurring in a volume element of surface area $S$ and thickness $\\Delta x$, where $\\Delta x$ is sufficiently small that the individual atoms (or other absorbing particles) within the volume do not overlap or shadow each other. The intensity of the stream of light emerging from our box of gas is $I + \\Delta I$ ; if there are no sources of light within the box, then we expect $\\Delta I ≤ 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a useful convention to express the probability that a photon will be absorbed by an absorbing particle in terms of a $\\textbf{cross-section}$ $\\sigma$ . Although the cross-section has units of area, it isn’t necessarily equal to the geometric cross-section of the absorbing particle. In fact, the cross-section is usually a strong function of wavelength if the absorption is due to atomic processes such as photoexcitation. If we assume that the volume element in Figure 5.9 has only a single absorbing particle within it, then the fraction of light lost in passing through is\n",
